This is a project using NextJS, typescript, Auth0, SASS, and Supabase to make a twitter clone

After loggin in with Auth0 you can leave the landing page and go to the app home page where a user can create new Mweets, follow other users, and see the mweets either they or people they follow have posted

In the following tab users will see only the mweets from people they follow. There is also a list of people they follow with the option to unfollow.

On the Profile tab users see their own profile with all of their mweets. If you click on the icon or tag for any user on the Home or Following page you will open their profile and can choose to follow or unfollow them from there.

Click on your own tag in the sidebar/footer to open your settings where you can change your display name and tag.

The app is responsive and adjusts to be usable on any screen size
